## Text Summarization Function Breakdown

### 1. Preprocessing:

- **Importing Libraries:** The code assumes libraries like stopwords and nltk are already imported for text processing.
- **Stopword Removal:** It creates a set of stopwords from the English language using `stopwords.words("english")`. Stopwords are common words like "the", "a", "is" that don't contribute much to meaning.
- **Tokenization:** It tokenizes the input text using `word_tokenize` which splits the text into individual words.

### 2. Frequency Analysis:

- It iterates through each word in the tokenized text.
- Converts the word to lowercase for case-insensitive analysis.
- Skips stopwords using the previously created set.
- If the word exists in the `freqTable` dictionary, it increments its frequency count.
- If the word is new, it adds it to the `freqTable` with a frequency of 1.

### 3. Sentence Scoring:

- It splits the text into sentences using `sent_tokenize`.
- Creates a dictionary `sentenceValue` to store scores for each sentence.
- Iterates through each sentence and checks if any word from the frequency table (`freqTable`) exists in that sentence (lowercased).
- If the word is found, it adds the word's frequency to the score of that sentence in `sentenceValue`.
- If the sentence score doesn't exist yet, it initializes it with the word's frequency.

### 4. Identifying Important Sentences:

- Calculates the total score of all sentences (`sumValues`).
- Finds the average sentence score by dividing the total score by the number of sentences.
- Iterates through each sentence again.
- If a sentence exists in `sentenceValue` (meaning it has some score) and its score is greater than 1.2 times the average score, it's considered an important sentence.

### 5. Building the Summary:

- An empty string `summary` is initialized.
- It iterates through each sentence again.
- If the sentence is considered important (based on the score), it's appended to the `summary` string.

### 6. Testing the Function:

- A sample text data is defined.
- The `solve` function is called with the data, and the returned summary is printed.

In essence, this function aims to identify sentences that have a higher concentration of non-stopwords compared to other sentences. These sentences are considered more informative and are included in the summary.

## Improvements to Consider:

- **Stemming or Lemmatization:** Consider using stemming or lemmatization to reduce words to their root form. This can improve the accuracy of frequency analysis.
- **Sentence Ranking:** Instead of a hard threshold (1.2 times average score), explore ranking sentences based on their scores and selecting a certain percentage for the summary.
- **More Sophisticated Scoring:** The current scoring only considers word frequency. You could explore techniques like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to weigh words based on their importance in the document.

This code provides a basic structure for automatic text summarization. With further enhancements, it can become a more robust tool for generating summaries of factual texts.
